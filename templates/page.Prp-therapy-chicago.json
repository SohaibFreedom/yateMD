Now, we are seeing exciting results with Platelet Rich Plasma treatment for hair growth and anti-aging of the face. A patient’s blood is drawn and spun in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets to a specific concentration effective for hair growth. Dr. Yates uses a specialized centrifuge that consistently gives concentrations of platelets at 4-7% of normal blood count. <br\/>\"Not all PRP is created equal\"<br\/>The platelets are then activated and injected back into the scalp at the level of the hair follicles. This process stimulates the body’s own growth factors and stem cells to slow hair loss, reverse miniaturized hair to produce a strong, visible hair again, and if used at the time of a hair transplant, it encourages faster graft growth. This has been very effective for both men and women.<\/p><p>See more information:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/pages\/men-and-womens-hair-styling\" title=\"Men And Women's Hair Styling\">PRP Treatments for Hair Loss<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pages\/faq\" title=\"FAQ\">PRP FAQ’s<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pages\/exosome-facial-treatments\" title=\"Exosome Facial Treatments\">Instructions before PRP Treatment<\/a><\/li><\/ul>","button_text":"","button_link":"","second_button_text":"","second_button_link":"","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/joel-mott-LaK153ghdig-unsplash-d1d33285-2880w.webp"}},"multicolumn_wgBq8Y":{"type":"multicolumn","blocks":{"column_RHxbeM":{"type":"column","settings":{"image_full_width":false,"title":"","text":"<p>Platelet Rich Plasma therapy is derived from the patient’s own blood serum.

PRP has long been used for enhanced wound healing and joint restoration but has now been found to actually stimulate new hair growth. This therapy can be used in conjunction with the surgical hair restoration procedures or alone for patients electing not to have surgery. Non-surgically, several studies have shown increased hair density at 4 months lasting for approximately 11 months.
