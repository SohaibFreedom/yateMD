You may elect to enroll any or all of your prescriptions in the Program and the Pharmacy will automatically refill each enrolled prescription whenever it is available to be filled. Each time a prescription is filled through the Program, you will be provided with a notification that the prescription is being refilled.<\/p><p>You may withdraw an individual prescription from the Program by logging into your account and clicking on the Change Plan tab. To stop automatic refills for a given prescription product, click the “Manage” button for that product and then click “CHANGE REFILL PREFERENCES”. To stop automatic refills, click the “I don’t want to see results” button on the modal that pops up after you click the “CHANGE REFILL PREFERENCES” button. You will receive an email confirming that you have changed your automatic refill preferences for that product.<\/p><p>You may completely disenroll from the Program by taking the steps outlined above for all of the prescription products in your plan.<\/p><p>Taking your treatment on a consistent basis gives you the best chance to see results, so we strongly recommend setting your preferences to receive automatic refills. This ensures that you’ll stay on track and receive your treatment without delay.<\/p>"}},"accordion_content_9nk73H":{"type":"accordion_content","settings":{"accordion_name":"How do I cancel my YatesMD subscription?","accordion_name_p":"<p>We're sorry to hear you want to cancel your YatesMD subscription, but we understand it might not be the fit for every guy.
