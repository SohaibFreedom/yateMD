All of the following procedures are steps we have always implemented in preparation and during patient care. Before you enter the examining room, all surfaces, such as procedure chair, procedure light, tables, countertops, drawer handles, light switches etc. have been cleaned and disinfected. Non-disposable items are cleaned and sterilized between patients. Disposable supplies and needles are never reused. Infection control precautions also require all staff to use appropriate protective equipment such as gloves, masks, gowns and eyewear as needed. After each patient, disposable gloves and masks are thrown away. Before seeing the next patient, everyone on the team washes their ands and puts on a new pair of gloves and masks.<\/p><h2><strong>What about the new coronavirus?<\/strong><\/h2><p>With so many news stories, it’s understandable to be concerned about the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
