Dr. Yates will follow the hair’s natural angle and vary the degree at different locations to ensure natural growth, which will allow the patient to comb their hair in any manner they want.<\/p><p>Dr. Yates recommends to his African American clients to consider combination therapy with FUE, Follicular Micro Pigmentation, and the use of Dr. Yates Hair Enhancing Protein Fibers.
